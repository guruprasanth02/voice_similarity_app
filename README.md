# 🎙️ Voice Similarity Application

## 📋 Overview
The Voice Similarity Application is designed to analyze and compare voice recordings to determine how similar they are to one another. This project leverages advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide users with accurate similarity scores based on their voice samples.

## ✨ Features
- 🔊 **Voice Comparison**: Users can upload two voice recordings, and the app will calculate a similarity score.
- 📊 **Visual Feedback**: The app provides visual representations of the audio waveforms and the similarity metrics.
- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to save their recordings and similarity results.
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: Users can view their past recordings and comparison results in a user-friendly dashboard.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Backend**: Python with Flask/Django for server-side logic.
- ⚛️ **Frontend**: React.js for a responsive user interface.
- 🗄️ **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data and recordings.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for analyzing voice similarity.
